    "Time series forecasting is crucial for making informed decisions in various fields such as finance, energy, and healthcare. Traditional deep learning models approach this problem through conditional generative modeling. The paper introduces TSDiff, an unconditional diffusion model for time series, which can handle multiple downstream tasks. The self-guidance mechanism allows TSDiff to perform predictive tasks during inference without conditional training. The model's generative capabilities are also leveraged to improve the accuracy of base forecasters and generate high-quality synthetic data."

    "\n",
    "The `trainer` in this context refers to an instance of the `pl.Trainer` class from the PyTorch Lightning library. PyTorch Lightning is a high-level library built on top of PyTorch that provides a structured and flexible framework for training deep learning models. It abstracts much of the boilerplate code involved in setting up training loops, validation, logging, and checkpointing, allowing researchers and developers to focus on the model and data.\n",

    "### Key Features of `pl.Trainer`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simplified Training Loop**:\n",
    "   - The `Trainer` handles the training loop, including forward and backward passes, gradient updates, and validation steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hardware Acceleration**:\n",
    "   - Supports training on multiple GPUs, TPUs, or CPUs with minimal code changes. The `accelerator` and `devices` parameters make it easy to specify the hardware configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Automatic Logging**:\n",
    "   - Integrates with logging frameworks like TensorBoard and Weights & Biases, enabling easy tracking of metrics and model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Checkpointing**:\n",
    "   - Automatically saves model checkpoints based on specified criteria (e.g., best validation loss), making it easy to resume training or deploy the best model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Callbacks**:\n",
    "   - Supports a wide range of callbacks for custom behavior during training, such as early stopping, learning rate scheduling, and custom evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Scalability**:\n",
    "   - Designed to scale from single-device training to multi-device and multi-node training with minimal code changes.\n"

    "- **Definition**: Normalized Deviation (ND) measures the average absolute deviation of the forecast from the actual values, normalized by the sum of the actual values.\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: \n",
    "  - ND gives an idea of the relative scale of the forecast errors compared to the actual values. \n",
    "  - Lower values indicate better model performance.\n",
    "  - It is particularly useful when dealing with time series data that may have different scales.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Definition**: Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values, normalized by the range of the actual values.\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: \n",
    "  - NRMSE provides a normalized measure of the forecast accuracy that accounts for the variability in the actual values.\n",
    "  - Lower values indicate better model performance.\n",
    "  - It is useful for comparing the performance of models across different datasets or scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### mean_wQuantileLoss (Mean Weighted Quantile Loss)\n",
    "- **Definition**: Mean Weighted Quantile Loss (mean_wQuantileLoss) measures the average quantile loss weighted by the quantile level. It assesses the accuracy of quantile forecasts, which provide a range of possible future values.\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: \n",
    "  - Quantile Loss evaluates the accuracy of probabilistic forecasts by penalizing over- and under-predictions differently depending on the quantile level.\n",
    "  - Lower values indicate better model performance.\n",
    "  - It is especially useful for applications where it is important to predict a range of possible future outcomes rather than a single point estimate.\n",

    "These metrics help in assessing the robustness and performance of the forecasting model under different scenarios, including scenarios with missing values, which is crucial for improving and fine-tuning the model's performance.\n"
