# Tabular Data Modeling Overview

Welcome to the diffusion model over tabular data modeling. This folder contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and code samples designed to enhance your understanding of applying diffusion models for tabular data synthesize. Here, we will explore three different algorithms: TabDDPM, TabSyn, and ClavaDDPM. While TabDDPM and TabSyn are designed for singule table data generation, ClavaDDPM is designed for multi-relational datasets synthesis. We will also study the quality of generated data using various metrics for each algorithm. Each algorithm has its own unique characteristics and applications, and we will cover them in detail in the following sections.
