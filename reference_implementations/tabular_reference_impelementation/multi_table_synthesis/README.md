# Diffusion Models for Multiple Table Data Overview

## Introduction
This folder contains the code implementation of ClavaDDPM, one of the most recent methods to use diffusion-based generative models for multi-relation tabular data generation. We provide Jupyter notebook demos to showcase its usage, including data loading, model training, sampling, and metrics computation.

## Notebook
Here you will find the main Jupyter notebook **ClavaDDPM**. This notebook covers the implementation of the ClavaDDPM algorithm for multi-relation tabular data synthesis. It includes a brief description of the algorithm, its implementation, and a demonstration of how to use it for sampling synthetic data and evaluating the quality of the synthetic data.

## Code
This section includes code structure and description of the files:
## TODO: Update code structure


## Getting Started
To get started with the materials in this topic:
1. Ensure you have followed the reference to the installation guide and environment setup in `\docs`.
2. Run the notebook `ClavaDDPM` to learn about the ClavaDDPM algorithm and its implementation step by step. Please first make sure to set the kernel to `diffusion_model` in the notebook.
