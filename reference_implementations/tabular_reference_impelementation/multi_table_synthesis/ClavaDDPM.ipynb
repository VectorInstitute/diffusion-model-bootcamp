    "# ClavaDDPM: Multi-relational Data Synthesis with Cluster-guided Diffusion Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent tabular data synthesis research has focused on single tables, while real-world applications often involve complex, interconnected tables. Existing methods for multi-relational data synthesis struggle with scalability and long-range dependencies. This paper introduces Cluster Latent Variable guided Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (ClavaDDPM), using clustering labels to model inter-table relationships, particularly foreign key constraints. ClavaDDPM efficiently propagates latent variables across tables, capturing long-range dependencies. Evaluations show ClavaDDPM outperforms existing methods on multi-table data and remains competitive for single-table data.\n",

Specifically, the clustering process corresponds to latent learning and is used for table augmentation during training. The subsequent steps involve training the conditional diffusion models and the cluster classifier models. Following this, we implement the generation process, starting with sampling the table size and conducting conditional generation to satisfy the parent-child constraints (i.e., relation order).\n",

Specifically, [Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVM)](https://pyro.ai/examples/gplvm.html) are used to discover low-dimensional manifolds in noisy, high-dimensional spaces. We run the clustering algorithm below to preprocess the data for training the ClavaDDPM model. Additionally, we empirically determine the distribution of table sizes in the dataset, which will be used in the later sampling process.\n",
