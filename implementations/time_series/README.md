# Time Series Data Modeling Overview

Welcome to the diffusion model over time series data. This folder contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and code samples designed to enhance your understanding of applying diffusion models for forcasting, imputing and synthesizing time series. Here, we will explore two different algorithms: csdi and tsdiff. While csdi are designed for forcasting and imputing multi-variate time series, tsdiff is mainly designed for synthesizing and forecasting time series data. Each algorithm has its own unique characteristics and applications, and we will cover them in detail in the following sections.

Please refer to `csdi` folder for imputing and forecasting time series, and `tsdiff` folder for forecasting and synthesizing time series reference implementations.
