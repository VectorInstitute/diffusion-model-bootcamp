# Diffusion Models for Tabular and Time Series Bootcamp

This repository contains codes for diffusion models bootcamp.

## About Diffusion Models for Tabular and Time Series Bootcamp

Diffusion models are a class of generative models that have shown promising results in various domains, including image generation, language modeling, and time series forecasting. In this bootcamp, we will explore the application of diffusion models to tabular and time series data.

## Repository Structure

- **docs/**: Contains detailed documentation, additional resources, installation guides, and setup instructions that are not covered in this README.
- **reference_implementations/**: Reference Implementations are organized by topics. Each topic has its own directory containing codes, notebooks, and a README for guidance.
- **data/**: Includes sample datasets or links to datasets used in the bootcamp, along with usage instructions. It also contains the implementation of dataset modules, or anything related to that.
- **scripts/**: Utility scripts for setup, data processing, submiting jobs, or other repetitive tasks.
- **pyproject.toml**: The `pyproject.toml` file in this repository configures various build system requirements and dependencies, centralizing project settings in a standardized format.


### Reference Implementations Directory

Each topic within the bootcamp has a dedicated directory in the `reference_implementations/` directory. In each directory, there is a README file that provides an overview of the topic, prerequisites, and notebook descriptions.

Here is the list of the covered topics:
- Tabular Data
  - TabDDPM for Tabular Data Generation
  - TabSyn for Tabular Data Generation and Imputation
  - ClavaDDPM for Multi-relational Tabular Data Generation
- Time series
    - CSDI for Time Series Forecasting and Imputation
    - TS-Diff for Time Series Forecasting, Synthesizing and Refining other Forecasting Models
